# [Jribbble.com](http://jribbble.com)

[Jribbble](http://github.com/tylergaw/jribbble) is a jQuery plugin for accessing the [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/api) api.

## Working

### JavaScript

The site uses Jribbble. It has a jQuery dependency that will be installed along with it.

```
bower install
```

### CSS/SCSS

This uses `node-sass`, installed globally:

```
npm install -g node-sass
```

and watch for scss changes with a Make command

```
make css
```
